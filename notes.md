  In many Asian economies, zombie firms have quietly become a structural feature rather than a cyclical anomaly.
      These are mature firms unable to cover debt-servicing costs, yet kept alive through continued credit access.
      While often framed as a micro-level inefficiency, their persistence raises a broader question:
      what happens when credit support becomes permanent rather than temporary?


  The first effect is macroeconomic. Economies with a higher zombie share experience weaker GDP growth
      and persistent disinflation. Capital and labor remain tied up in low-productivity firms,
      reducing competitive pressure and dampening investment among healthier firms.
      Credit allocation becomes less responsive to fundamentals.
      Over time, aggregate growth slows and price pressures weaken.

  But the story does not stop at national borders.
      Asian economies are deeply integrated into global value chains and trade networks.
      When zombie prevalence rises, its effects spill outward.
      Economies with stronger trade exposure to Asia experience greater disinflationary pressure
      and slower growth when Asian zombie shares increase.
      What appears as a domestic credit misallocation problem becomes a regional,
      even global, macroeconomic force.

  The second pillar of the project uncovers a bank-balance-sheet channel.
      Banks with weaker capital positions and higher non-performing loan ratios
      have stronger incentives to evergreen distressed loans.
      By rolling over debt rather than recognizing losses,
      these banks delay restructuring and maintain the appearance of balance-sheet stability.
      Yet this short-term stabilization comes at a cost:
      risks accumulate, productivity stagnates, and financial fragility builds beneath the surface.

  The interaction between weak firms and weak banks forms a feedback loop.
      Zombie firms persist because banks avoid loss recognition;
      banks become more fragile as zombie exposure increases.
      What begins as a strategy to prevent immediate distress
      can gradually transform into systemic stagnation.

  Zombification is therefore not merely a firm-level inefficiency.
      It is a macro-financial dynamic linking corporate distress,
      bank weakness, and global disinflationary pressures.
      Stabilization policies aimed at protecting employment and financial intermediaries
      may, under certain conditions, reshape the trajectory of the next credit cycle.
