### Xiaoxi (Amanda) Liu, Ph.D.
📄 [Download my CV](CV_Xiaoxi_Liu_2026jan.pdf)

Credit builds bridges across economies, but those same bridges can carry contagion. Understanding finance means tracing the paths along which liquidity and risk travel. I study how **credit markets** and **global financial networks** shape risks, crises, and the shifting balance of power in the world economy. I combine granular micro-level data with macro-financial analysis to uncover transmission mechanisms that are not visible in aggregate statistics.
