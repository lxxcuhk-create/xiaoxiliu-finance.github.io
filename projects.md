My recent research explores how **credit markets**, **banks**, and **global financial networks**
shape fragility, resilience, and macro-financial spillovers.

  <h3>Treasury Market Fragility and Liquidity Management</h3>
  <div class="project-meta">
    Review of Financial Studies (2025)
  </div>
  Bond mutual funds hold Treasuries as liquidity buffers against redemption shocks.
  Yet this very practice can transmit non-fundamental flow shocks into the
  safest market in the world. This paper documented that Treasury excess return volatility
  rises with bond fund ownership, particularly among funds that engage in
  intensive liquidity management. Exploiting the SEC’s 2017 Liquidity Risk
  Management Rule and the COVID-19 turmoil provides causal evidence of this channel.

    Key insight: Stability mechanisms at the fund level can generate fragility
    at the system level.

  <h3>Redundant Securities and Market Completion</h3>
  <div class="project-meta">
    General Equilibrium & Empirical Study — Corporate Bond Markets (2026)
  </div>
  Financial innovation is often viewed as duplication rather than necessity.
  This project examines whether introducing a seemingly redundant security
  can improve allocation in corporate bond markets with frictions.
  In a general equilibrium framework, this paper shows that an additional instrument
  may alleviate liquidity and participation constraints and improve market functioning.
  The theoretical results are supported by empirical evidence from bond

  Key insight: Redundancy in theory does not imply irrelevance in practice.
  With frictions, additional securities can increase welfare by relaxing binding constraints.

  <h3>Zombie Firms, Bank Evergreening, and Macro Spillovers</h3>
  <div class="project-meta">
    Credit Misallocation, Bank Balance Sheets, and Disinflationary Effects (2026)
  </div>
  This project examines how the persistence of zombie firms reshapes macroeconomic outcomes in Asia. 
  Economies with a higher zombie share experience weaker GDP growth and sustained disinflation. 
  These effects spill across borders through trade linkages, transmitting deflationary pressure 
  beyond national boundaries. At the micro level, banks with weaker capital positions and higher 
  balance-sheet stress are more likely to evergreen loans to distressed firms, sustaining 
  non-viable businesses and delaying necessary restructuring.
  <div class="project-insight">
    Key insight: When weak banks roll over weak firms, short-term stability can translate 
    into slower growth, persistent disinflation, and accumulated systemic risk.

    Using bilateral FDI, portfolio, and banking data, this paper maps China’s evolving position in global finance.

      Key insight: Global finance is increasingly shaped by network structure, not just volume.
