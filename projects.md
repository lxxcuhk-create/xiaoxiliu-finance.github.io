My research explores how **credit markets**, **banks**, and **global financial networks**
shape fragility, resilience, and macro-financial spillovers.

## Treasury Market Fragility and Liquidity Management  
**(Review of Financial Studies, 2025)**

Bond mutual funds play an important role in Treasury market liquidity,
but liquidity management can also amplify volatility during stress episodes.

**Key insight:** Market fragility is often an endogenous outcome of liquidity demand.

*Selected publication:*  
- *Does Liquidity Management Induce Fragility in Treasury Prices?* (RFS, Editor’s Choice)

## Zombie Firms and Credit Misallocation in Asia  
**(BIS Working Paper, ongoing)**

I study the rise of zombie firms in Asia and how subsidized credit allocation
can weaken productivity dynamics and generate macro-financial spillovers.

**Key insight:** Credit support may delay restructuring and reshape regional growth risks.

## China’s Firm–Bank Nexus and Lending Dynamics  
**(with BIS/SNB collaborators)**

This project examines how bank–firm relationships interact with credit conditions,
risk-taking, and regulatory constraints in China’s financial system.

**Key insight:** Micro-level bank linkages can matter for aggregate stability.

## China’s Global Financial Linkages and Spillovers  
**(IMF collaboration, multi-layer investment networks)**

Using bilateral data on FDI, portfolio investment, and cross-border banking,
I map the evolution of China’s international financial network
and quantify spillover channels.

**Key insight:** Global finance is increasingly shaped by network structure, not just volume.

## Shadow Credit and Regulatory Arbitrage  
**(Journal of Banking & Finance, 2024)**

I document how shadow lending channels respond to regulatory constraints,
highlighting unintended consequences of policy design.

**Key insight:** Credit can migrate across balance sheets when regulation tightens.

Many of these projects involve large-scale bilateral datasets and network visualizations.
Figures and maps are available in the **Visual Lab** section.
