My recent research explores how **credit markets**, **banks**, and **global financial networks**
shape fragility, resilience, and macro-financial spillovers.

  <h3>Treasury Market Fragility and Liquidity Management</h3>
  <div class="project-meta">
    Review of Financial Studies (2025)
  </div>
  Bond mutual funds hold Treasuries as liquidity buffers against redemption shocks.
  Yet this very practice can transmit non-fundamental flow shocks into the
  safest market in the world. We document that Treasury excess return volatility
  rises with bond fund ownership, particularly among funds that engage in
  intensive liquidity management. Exploiting the SEC’s 2017 Liquidity Risk
  Management Rule and the COVID-19 turmoil provides causal evidence of this channel.

    Key insight: Stability mechanisms at the fund level can generate fragility
    at the system level.

  <h3>Redundant Securities and Market Completion</h3>
  <div class="project-meta">
    General Equilibrium & Empirical Study — Corporate Bond Markets
  </div>
  Financial innovation is often viewed as duplication rather than necessity.
  This project examines whether introducing a seemingly redundant security
  can improve allocation in corporate bond markets with frictions.
  In a general equilibrium framework, I show that an additional instrument
  may alleviate liquidity and participation constraints and improve market functioning.
  The theoretical results are supported by empirical evidence from bond

  Key insight: Redundancy in theory does not imply irrelevance in practice.
  With frictions, additional securities can increase welfare by relaxing binding constraints.
